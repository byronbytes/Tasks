**Tasks** is an application that improves computer performance. **Tasks**'s main features include an advanced cleanup tool, a startup manager, and a detailed Task Manager. These tools help improve computer performance, system boot times, and ensures a safer experience while using your computer.

### Intentions
We aim to make a lightweight, free, intuitive and responsive cleaning tool. We believe that computer performance is crucial to everyone and should not include any hidden paywalls inside the application. Our goal is to make a tool that anyone can use from anywhere.

## List of Features

- Advanced Cleanup Tool to help computer performance

- Extension Removal Tool to help remove malicious or unwanted extensions

- Bloatware Removal Tool to help remove bloat on your computer

- Startup Manager to improve system boot times.

- Advanced Task Manager to give more details about processes.

3. Extract the `.zip` and execute `Tasks.exe`.
