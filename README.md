**Tasks** is an application which improves computer performance. **Tasks** has an advanced cleanup tool, allowing you to clean application, cache files as well as manage browser extensions, clear cookies and remove bloatware. Tasks also feature a startup manager, letting you control programs that run on startup.

## Installation
1. Get [.NET Core](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) directly from Microsoft. (Tasks will notice if you have installed .NET Core or not.)
2. Get Tasks from the **Releases** tab.
3. Extract the `.zip` and execute the `.exe` file.

Please put the dependencies alongside with the `.exe` file. Tasks will not work without the dependencies.

We aim to make a lightweight, free, intuitive and responsive cleaning tool. We believe that computer performance is crucial and will never include any hidden paywalls in the application.
