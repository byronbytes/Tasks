**Tasks** is an application that boosts computer performance and cleans computer files. **Tasks** has an advanced cleanup tool that allows you to clean application, cache files as well as uninstall unused browser extensions, clear cookies, and also remove bloatware! Tasks also include a startup manager that allows the modification of programs that run on startup

## Installation
Installing Tasks is very simple, as the application is currently portable.
1. Download the stable release from the Releases tab.
2. Extract the .zip, and execute the .exe file. After that, Tasks will launch.

Note that the dependencies must be kept in the same folder. This is required until Tasks dependencies are bundled in the executable itself. Currently, this is not the case.

### Prerequisites
Before you can run Tasks, you will need to install [.NET Core](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) directly from Microsoft.

## Support The Project
You can support our project in many ways, simply by using Tasks, leaving a star, forking, watching and reporting issues too. We also set up a donation system, so all your donations and sponsors go directly to us.
