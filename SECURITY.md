# Security Policy
This is the current Security Policy for Tasks. Last updated on January 25th, 2022.

## About
This is the guideline for reporting security vulnerabilities. If you have found one it is very important you report it as soon as possible before any malicious intents get to any other people.

## Reporting a Vulnerability
To report a new vulnerability, please create a new issue using the **Security Vulnerability** template. Click [here](https://github.com/LiteTools/Tasks/issues) to go to the Issues Tab.

### Notice
Even though Tasks is more of a "local" application and does not have a public API or database yet, there can still be vulnerabilites within our code (Example: A feature that can exploit Windows features for malicious intents.)



### Supported Versions
These are the supported versions of Tasks. We will not fix vulnerabilities in older versions that are marked with the :x: sign.
